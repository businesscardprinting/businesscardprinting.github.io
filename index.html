At Print Peppermint we print 4-shading counterbalance in light of the unrivaled shading and picture quality that solitary 4-shading balance printing can offer. 

What is 4-Color Offset Printing? 

In 4-shading balance printing "counterbalance" alludes to the way that the printed picture doesn't straightforwardly go on to the paper. In spite of the procedure of computerized printing which uses toners and print heads, counterbalance printing uses plates to move a picture onto an elastic cover. This elastic cover at that point rolls the picture onto a sheet of paper. By isolating hues into plates, CMYK or potentially Pantone Spot Color we keep up more prominent authority over the printing procedure. The final product is a higher quality print with astounding shading exactness and fresh subtleties, something which computerized printing can't contend with.

Cost-adequacy with enormous amounts 

Shading predominance
